Hello, herewith I present a performance oriented solution against NPCs. Instead of removing them client-side, I use the Serverside Native [SetRoutingBucketPopulationEnabled()](https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0xCE51AC2C). 

Just add all dimensions which are used to the config and you're done.

**For the simple handling of dimensions see:**
[GetPlayerRoutingBucket()](https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0x52441C34)
[SetPlayerRoutingBucket()](https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0x6504EB38)

[GetEntityRoutingBucket()](https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0xED4B0486)
[SetEntityRoutingBucket()](https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0x635E5289)
